<div class="alert">
  <p>Although this functionality should be used sparingly, you can hide a pane on individual breakpoints.</p>
  <p>The Bootstrap term for this functionality is <em>Responsive Utility classes.</em> You can read more about it in the Bootstrap documentation. Follow the link below to learn more.</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Visibility classes <strong>do not</strong> inherit up. If you set this pane to be hidden on the xs breakpoint for example, it will still appear on the other breakpoints. And vice-versa.</p>
